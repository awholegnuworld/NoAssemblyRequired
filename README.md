Welcome to your final Javascript framework. NoAssemblyRequired aims to be the only framework that you ever need when developing your projects. While always adapting and changing, NAR (NoAssemblyRequired) acts as a compatibility layer between various languages, frameworks, and architectures.

NAR is a project built in the spirit of DPATL (R.I.P). DPATL aimed to allow the use of all programing langauges, on any device. It achieved this by running the code server-side. This was extremely slow and wasteful. Out of the ashes of DPATL, a new, web3 compatible project is born:

NoAssemblyRequired runs on the client-side. It runs entirely server-agnostic, making it compatible with IPFS technology. Nothing is compiled before hand, so dynamic pages are able to be encoded on blockchains. NAR will allow uses to utilize frameworks like Angular and JQuery without setting them up. Below are the langauges that NAR currently supports:
* SCSS
* Perl

If you enjoy this project, make sure to thank the people who helped to make it!
