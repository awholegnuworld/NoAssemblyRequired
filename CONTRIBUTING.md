Thank you for taking the time to contribute to NAR! Your contributions will help improve the project for everyone! Before you contribute, there are a few things that you should keep in mind.

* Is my edit helpful?
* Is my edit going to degrade the experience for others?
* Am I reversing another's edit in bad faith?

Generally, if the first is true, you are good to go! You should have answered YES, NO, NO. This project belongs to the community, and it is your duty as a user to help upkeep it. If you see someone breaking these rules, please report them in a Github Discussion.

All development will occur on the dev branch, with the dev branch being merged with the master branch when stable. All PRs are to be pulled into the dev branch.
