# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

The current version is generally the only version that is supported. I will try to add updates to older versions if they are used a lot. If you absolutely need to use an older version, I may be able to provide updates if you contact me.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please open a Github Discussion if you find a security vulnerability. I will try my best to fix it as quickly as possible.
